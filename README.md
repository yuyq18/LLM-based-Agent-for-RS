## Background

**LLM-based Agent**, or called LLM-empowered generative agents, refers to autonomous agents which employs LLMs as brains or central controllers, aiming at leveraging the human-like capabilities of LLMs. 

**In recommender systems**, LLM-based Agent can be applied for user simulation, better recommendation, etc.
